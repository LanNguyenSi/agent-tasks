# Changelog

All notable changes to `@agent-tasks/mcp-server` are documented here.

## 0.3.0

### Added
- `projects_get` — fetch a single project by slug or id (auto-routes).
- `review_approve` — approve a task in review.
- `review_request_changes` — request changes on a task in review.
- `review_claim` — acquire the single-reviewer lock.
- `review_release` — release the review lock without approving or requesting changes.

Closes CLI-parity gap: MCP-only agents can now drive the review loop end-to-end, including the distinct-reviewer gate introduced in v0.2.0. Same five tools are mirrored in the HTTP MCP peer at `POST /api/mcp`.

## 0.2.0

### Added
- `pull_requests_create` / `pull_requests_merge` / `pull_requests_comment` — GitHub PR operations via delegation.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release. Twelve tools covering projects, tasks, signals, transitions, updates, and comments.
