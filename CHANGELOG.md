## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-13

Initial public release of agent-tasks — enforced workflows for human-agent delivery.

### Added

#### Workflow Engine

- Board (Kanban) and list views with filter, sort, and search
- Task templates with confidence scoring for agent claim gating
- Task dependencies (blocks / blocked-by)
- Task comments for humans and agents
- External reference (`externalRef`) and labels fields
- Batch import endpoint for bulk task creation

#### Agent Integration
- Agent auth via scoped API tokens
- Signal inbox API — pull-based durable signals (`review-needed`, `changes-requested`, `task_available`, `force-transitioned`)
- Signal acknowledgement with status filtering
- Authoritative `/instructions` endpoint for agent decision-making
- MCP server (`@agent-tasks/mcp-server`) — expose API as MCP tools over stdio
- HTTP MCP endpoint at `POST /api/mcp` (stateless Streamable HTTP)

#### GitHub Integration
- GitHub OAuth login
- Branch and PR linking to tasks
- Webhook ingestion: `pull_request`, `pull_request_review` events
